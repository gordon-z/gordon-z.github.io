      <h2>Background</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I am a 4th year Computer Engineering student at McMaster University, graduating in Summer 2022.
        As a student in the tech industry, I love working with data and creating solutions that make meaningful impacts on
        people's lives on a day to day basis. During my past internships, I have developed not only hard skills in 
        development, testing, debugging, but I was also presented with many opportunities to fine tune my soft skills
        in communication, organization, and problem-solving. I have excelled in all of my previous roles and believe
        that my number one asset is my ability to adapt to any challenge I am presented with.
